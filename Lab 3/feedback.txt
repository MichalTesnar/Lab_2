- Efficiency & Simplicity: 0.75 - Clarity: 1 - Other subtractions: - Comments: - Well written functions for building the tree. - It is unnecessary to pass a pointer to a tree in most functions, except for those for building the tree, because you cannot return the tree in those functions. This adds a lot of extra dereferences and parantheses that would otherwise be avoided. - You could have merged some cases in the simplify function. - You are making more copies than necessary in the derivative function. In particular, you make a copy of the left and right child in the case of the '*' symbol, but then you free it right after. So you could have just used the original ones in the first place.
